In my courses, most assignments clearly detail their goals; and, sometimes even objectives or tasks to follow. However, when designing a program things are not as clear-cut. In addition to my coursework, I attempt various side projects based off ideas I have and most recently began working on a project for a separate group. Most projects were transient as there was not a lot of thought behind them. I would mostly attempt to program them without defining my goals and I did not follow a design process. Throughout this term, I was able to work on a variety of projects which helped to develop my own personal design philosophy. </span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">User-Centric Design</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the start of this class, my understanding of design was that good design is something that is easy to use and looks appealing. The first assignment in this class was to choose two designs, one good and one bad, and support each case. This assignment was closely connected to the next assignment which was to redesign a website on the mobile platform for a given demographic. These projects taught me how design is impacted by the users&rsquo; needs. For example, in the Good and Bad Design project I pointed out that the WPI website has a good design because its users can find the information they are looking for in a timely manner. </span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: -0.00px 0.00px; border: 2.67px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 296.00px;"><img alt="" src="assets/gb1.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 296.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c8">WPI website home page (Good Design, Bad Design)</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It organizes navigation options clearly and has separate sections for some of their target demographics which are students, parents, faculty, and alumni. Similarly, in the Design for Others project since we were designing for one demographic, we first targeted them through the links on the homepage, and the priority of those links. Later on, we improved the design of key parts of the site that our demographic would use. I applied the importance of designing with the user in mind which remains part of my design philosophy.</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">User Testing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a Computer Science student, I have been required to write test cases for multiple assignments which are usually my lowest priority. While program test cases may not be the same as user testing, my philosophy before this class was that testing in general was low priority or something to save for the end. This class changed my understanding of testing. Before each project was due other than the first, one day was dedicated as a demo day for the project. We received feedback from multiple groups testing our demos which proved valuable to our project design. While we could not always implement all the ideas we received I realized how much it improved our projects. The biggest example of this was the Design for Wellbeing project. Our group developed the clone of the Flappy Bird game with a comedic twist. For the wellbeing aspect we paused the game if the camera detected that the user was angry or frustrated and displayed an appropriate message. Some of the feedback we received from our peers was that the site was too plain, the colors were too bright, and the layout was awkward. After that, we designed a new layout for the site and improved the site based on the feedback. </span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 297.33px;"><img alt="" src="assets/dw1.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 297.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Before student feedback (Design for Wellbeing)</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 308.00px;"><img alt="" src="assets/dw2.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 308.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">After student feedback (Design for Wellbeing)</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After the several demo days, I came to appreciate the importance of user testing and it has become an important part of my design philosophy and it should be done more often in an iterative process which we could not do within the course&rsquo;s time constraints.</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Do Not Commit</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I would say that the biggest flaw in myself that I have encountered in this class was committing too much to one idea. While the groups I was a part of brainstormed various ideas for each project we would always try to commit to one design early to have more time to work on it. Sometimes, we would run into issues that would sidetrack our project. The most prominent example in my portfolio would be the Design for Understanding project. While we liked our design, the issue we faced was that no one in our group had the technical experience to create the visualization. In the first few days we attempted to display the data of diseases in the United States on a map with different opacities of a color to represent the number of cases. After we realized we were not able to create that design we went with a more simplistic design with a scatter plot and only included the data for one disease. By committing to one of our earlier designs we did not have as much time to fine tune the visualization or develop a better version of it. While other projects had technical challenges, this was more difficult because we committed too much to one design. Overall, this project made me realize that it is important to keep the design space open and not commit too much to one project and that one should design for within their team&rsquo;s capabilities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 293.83px; height: 391.50px;"><img alt="" src="assets/du1.jpeg" style="width: 293.83px; height: 391.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 292.50px; height: 390.56px;"><img alt="" src="assets/du2.jpeg" style="width: 292.50px; height: 390.56px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Original design vs final design (Design for Understanding)</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are several things I have learned from this class about design. My major takeaways are to always design with the user in mind, test designs as often as possible to get useful feedback, and to not commit to a design too early as you may face issues which are difficult to manage with time constraints. As a Computer Science major, this course made me think about things I would normally not consider but should have been considering. My personal design philosophy may change over time, and I will be able to apply it to my personal projects and future career endeavors.</span></p><div><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c4"></span></p></div></body></html>
